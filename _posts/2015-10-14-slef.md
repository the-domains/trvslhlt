Like most of you, we find ourselves lamenting the loss of the capability to misspell words when singing into expensive microphones. We kick off each week with an aided plea to the DAC/ADC lobby, DAC/ADC Inc., who resolutely refuse to reply via email on the grounds that all written communication undermines their constituencies' interests. Now you go right ahead and call us old fashioned but we were raised with the understanding that there comes a time in every middle-aged hardware company's life in which it must look itself in the mirror and say "I will no longer shave at a fogged over piece of glass for fear of accidentally clearing a malformed word from the condensation."  Beginning in March, the library initiated its divestment from all expensive microphones. null
